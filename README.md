## 🤔 What Is This?

Tumbleweed's bleeding-edge rolling release ships newer libraries than many applications expect. This causes crashes, missing features, and general headaches.

**Gecko Glue** provides automated scripts and documentation to bridge the gap between Tumbleweed and stubborn software.

## 🎯 Supported Applications

| Application | Status | Issues Fixed |
|-------------|--------|--------------|
| 🎮 Unity3D | ✅ Working | SSL certs, libxml2, Asset Store links |
| 🎬 DaVinci Resolve | ✅ Working | GLib mismatch, Intel Arc OpenCL, VA-API |
| 🖨️ Epson Printers | ✅ Working | Epson Scan 2 crash, IPP setup |

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/ItsNishi/GeckoGlue.git
cd GeckoGlue

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Run the fix you need
sudo ./scripts/fix-unity3d.sh
sudo ./scripts/fix-davinci-resolve.sh
sudo ./scripts/fix-epson.sh
```
